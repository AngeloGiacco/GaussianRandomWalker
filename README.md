# GaussianRandomWalker

A random walker built with p5.js using a gaussian distribution
The random walker will have equal chance in going in different directions, but lengths are defined by a gaussian distribution
User should be able to define the distribution's parameters: mean and standard deviation
To expand the project, user could also define probabilites of the random walker going in each of the four directions
Using p5.js, this code will show a screen where a white line will display the walker going around the screen.
